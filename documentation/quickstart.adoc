=== The Things Network Setup

The system requires a The Things Network application. To do so create a TTN account and use the https://console.cloud.thethings.network/[TTN cloud console]. You will require the region, the id and the EUI of the application later. An access key with read and write privileges must also be generated and noted down. Lastly setup the decoder function for the created TTN application using the following Javascript code:

.TTN Payload Decoder Function
[source,javascript]
----
function decode_int16(byte_high, byte_low) {
  var int16 = ((byte_high << 8) | byte_low);
  if (int16 == 32767) {
    return null;
  } else {
    return int16 / 100.0;
  }
}

function Decoder(bytes, port) {
  var decoded = {};

  decoded.temperature = decode_int16(bytes[1], bytes[0]);
  decoded.humidity = decode_int16(bytes[3], bytes[2]);
  decoded.ir_temperature = decode_int16(bytes[5],  bytes[4]);
  decoded.brightness_current = (bytes[9] << 24) | (bytes[8] << 16) | (bytes[7] << 8) | bytes[6];
  decoded.battery_voltage = bytes[10] / 10.0;

  return decoded;
}
----

=== Development Environment

The setup of the local development environment requires quite a few steps. First and foremost, for Sensor Nodes to be able to actively communicate their measurements to the backend, they require a The Things Network gateway in LoRA communications range. A good gateway for getting started which is available for less than 100â‚¬ is the https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/gateways/thethingsindoor/[TTN Indoor Gateway].

==== local-dev Deployment

To start the required services (PostgreSQL database, Telegraf and InfluxDB) to get the backend and frontend up and running use the local-dev deployment stage. Create an `.env` file using the following content, save it as `deployment/local-dev/.env` and execute `deployment/local-dev/deploy-local-dev.sh` afterwards:

.local-dev Deployment Example .env FIle

Running the frontend:: Install the required packages using `npm install` and run the frontend with `npm run start`. It should now accessible using the browser of your choice under http://localhost:4200.

=== Hardware Fabrication

Export Gerber files:: You can use KiCAD to export Geber files under File > Plot. Use the settings required by your manufacturer.
Fabrication:: The existing sensor nodes have been fabricated by https://aisler.net/[Aisler] as 'Beautiful Boards Budget' with a thickness of 1,6mm.
Assembly:: See <<Bill of Materials>> for a detailed list of all parts required for the assembly of a sensor node board. The surface mount components of the existing sensor nodes have been assembled using solder paste and a stencil manufactured also by Aisler. 

=== Embedded Software

Environment variables:: Make sure to export the following environment variables before proceeding. The values for these are unique per Sensor and can be obtained from the administration section of the frontend. For that purpose, create a new or view an existing sensor and click the Keys button under TTN Keys.

|===

Prerequisites:: `cmake` and `gcc-arm-none-eabi` are required to build the embedded software.
Go to software directory:: `cd <project root>/software/embedded/sensor-node/`
Create build directory:: `cmake -E make_directory build && cd build`
Run CMake:: `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
Run CMake build:: `cmake --build . --config Release`
Flash onto hardware:: Use the STM32 ST-Link utility to flash the created binary onto the microcontroller. You will need an ST-Link programmer and an adapter from your programmer to SWD (2x5 1.27mm) (for example https://www.adafruit.com/product/2094[this one] from Adafruit). For the first flashing of a brand new microcontroller, you may need to use ST-Link utility to disable the Option Byte `nBoost0_SW_Cfg`. For later flashings, you can use any other utility such as OpenOCD which can be directly done from your IDE.

.Overview of all Parts
image::parts-overview-cable-ties.jpeg[Parts for Assembly]

==== Assembly Steps

Add acrylic glass sheet:: Glue the acrylic glass sheet into the matching cutout of the upper half of the case from the inside.
Add logo:: Apply the self-adhesive logo sticker next to the cutout from the outside.
Mount PCB:: Screw the PCB onto the lower half of the case using the two M2 screws. You will need to apply a lot of pressure to force these into the 3d-printed screw holes.
Insert batteries:: If haven done so already, insert the two AAA batteries into the holder. You should have flashed the firmware and verified that sensor successfully communicates with TTN and the Urban Climate Monitor web solution by now. 
Close the case:: Place the lower half of the case in the upper half of the case and screw them together using the 4 M3 screws.
